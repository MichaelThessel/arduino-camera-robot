# Camera inspection rover

This repository contains the firmware and the CAD files used to construct a
basic camera inspection rover.

# Components

The rover is build based on a modified 1:18 scale RC car.
The model used here is a PulseLabZ HS18321 but this should work with pretty much
any RC car.

The car is modified to work with a Futaba R2004GF 2.4GHz 4 channel receiver.

2 Channels of the receiver control the servos for the X and Y axis of the camera
gimbal. One channel controls the motor speed and the remaining channel controls
the servo for the steering.

The 2 servos in the gimbal are Hobby King HK 933s.
